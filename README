Project Compilers

Compiling

Using the c2p shell command, it's possible to compile a SmallC source file. The execution of the compilation process is powered by Ant. In the Ant build file build.xml, there's two executable targets, c2p and unittests. The c2p target will execute the compiler. The target unittests provides some regression tests on the compiler features.

Grammar

The grammar was build using the ANTLR Tools. You can find it in the subdirectory ./grammar

Class Diagram
